# Medialane: Creators Capital Markets on the Integrity Web

Medialane is the monetization hub financial infrastructure for the Creators Capital Markets, with Creators Launchpad and IP Marketplace engineered for the integrity web, to enable trustless, verifiable financial activity. Our vision is to ensure that creators, businesses, and AI can fully own, trade, and generate capital from intellectual property with sovereignty, control, and transparency.

Our ecosystem is engineered to support the next generation of finance, a verifiable engine that allows humans and autonomous AI agents to generate value and revenue streams.

The core of our business operates through two integrated financial hubs. The Creator Launchpad is the engine for capital structuring, facilitating the creation of financial assets and structured revenue products such as IP Coins, Creator Coins, Collection Drops, IP Clubs, Memberships, Subscriptions, and IP Tickets. Complementing this is the NFT Marketplace, which functions as the High-Integrity Exchange, the central secondary market for the licensing and trading of all tokenized creator assets.

We provide the definitive operating environment for creative capital, eliminating intermediaries and friction through key principles. Creators maintain Sovereign Capital—complete ownership over their assets and decentralized identity, which is the basis for their market activity. Utilizing the Mediolano primitives, assets feature Programmable Licensing, giving creators precise control over usage and remix terms with contracts generated automatically. 

Medialane is sustained by a clear fee model: a 2% service fee is applied to Creator Launchpad revenue products, and a 1% total fee is collected on all NFT Marketplace trading, auctions, remix, and licensing services. Medialane is designed to serve the future of creators' capital markets, businesses, and AI agents—without compromise.
